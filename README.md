# Intro to DDD

## Use Case

As an employee, I want to request a leave. I can request a leave for a period of 1 or more days. 
I can not request a leave longer then the days I have open in my balance. 
If I want, I can add an additional comment to my request to provide context for my manager.

As a manager, I should be aware of pending leave requests. 
I can either approve or deny a request. When I deny a request, 
I must give a reason for the denial. No reason is needed when approving a request.
